                    I created a prototype tailored to streamline technical inquiries, redefining the search experience
                    for developers.
                    I went through the full process of mocking up a solution to the startup's concept.

                <p class="paragraph">The intended audience of hello consists of developers and computer science
                    students/
                    professionals. They can use hello to receive fast answers to their technical questions.
                    Because of the coding nature of the startup, we chose to design a desktop interface.
                    Using this as a jumping-off point, we had discussions to decide which features would be the
                    most beneficial for our website.

                        provide all the necessary tools and resources for developers.

                    </li>
                    <li>There should be an option to filter for programming languages as it would bring the most

                    Furthermore, we wanted a clean yet unique look, which separated our startup's project from other

                    High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">Using Figma, we created our first interactive high-fidelity prototype. While making
                    our design,
                    we choose a clean look with minimal distractions. The chosen fonts reflect the startup's technical
                    nature.
                    We paid special attention to text hierarchy and color scheme to make our page easy to read and
                    navigate.
                    By using contrasting colors, such as black text on a blue background, we made the font more visible
                    so that anyone could read the website.
                    We chose to use icons on our website to express possible actions, such as bookmarking and history,
                    to grab the user's attention
                    and help the users find the content they are looking for. We made sure to use icons that the user
                    can easily understand.
                    We added a split screen option for users to view 'Web Answers' and 'Hello Answers', which are
                    generated simultaneously by hello's AI algorithm.

                    On the 'Web Results' section, the user can view further resources if they need.

                    They appreciated the minimal design of 'Hello Answers' page as there were no distractions. Some
                    users mentioned that they were expecting to be a profile button on the homepage. They also added that they

                </h4>
                <p class="paragraph">Based on the feedback, we would definitely give less space to the web results.
                    It was mentioned multiple times that the main draw of the platform is the hello answers,
                    so the web answers can be deprioritized since users can just go to Google if they wanted that.
                    Additionally, we could include a dropdown arrow after a language is chosen from the “see more”
                    dropdown to show that users can change languages if they make a mistake.

                        <p>
                            Using Figma, we created our first interactive high-fidelity prototype.
                            While making our design, we choose a clean look with minimal distractions.
                            The chosen fonts reflect the startup's technical nature.
                            We paid special attention to text hierarchy and color scheme to make our page easy to read
                            and navigate.
                            By using contrasting colors, such as black text on a blue background, we made the font more
                            visible so that anyone could read the website.
                            We chose to use icons on our website to express possible actions, such as bookmarking and
                            history, to grab the user's
                            attention and help the users find the content they are looking for. We made sure to use
                            icons that the user can
                            easily understand. We added a split screen option for users to view 'Web Answers' and 'Hello
                            Answers', which are generated simultaneously by hello's AI algorithm.

                                    <li>Added text to the “split screen” icon to make it clearer</li>
